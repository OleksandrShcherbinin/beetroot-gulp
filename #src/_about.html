                <p class="we-do-wrapper-article-info__text">Increasing prosperity in our
                    lives can be accomplished by having the right frame of mind.
                    The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful. They are capable of
                    influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical
                    health to our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage,
                    “As you think, so shall you be. ”If we want to improve our lives,
                    we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of thought
                    in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives,
                    including our financial well-being and prosperity. But how?
                    How do we take something as intangible as thoughts, and manifest
                    them into a physical reality? We must first understand that being
                    prosperous is more than having a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset,
                    a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking.
                    Mastering this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough
                    if we keep working on it consistently.
                    Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts,
                    and ultimately attract more prosperity into your life: Be grateful
                    for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day
                    to express heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life.
                    Even more powerful, write a few of these blessings down each day.
                    This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on abundance, not lack.
                    Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively.
                    Use “I am” statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.”
                    Write the statements down and repeat them nightly before bed.
                    Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious
                    mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them. Creative visualization
                    can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
                    achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind.
                This works in the same way affirmations do.Our subconscious will
                    fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious
                    “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous,
                    and you will become so. Encourage yourself with the belief that you can
                    achieve great things. This could also be one of your affirmations,
                    but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary,
                    tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible,
                    and you will gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could.
                    If you believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks
                associated with people who are highly successful.Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.
                    Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this:
                    Like Attracts Like. Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars
                    into your account every month, it will begin to build up and attract more money.
                    Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our
                    thoughts is such that we lend more power and energy to whatever we
                    consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will create more lack.
                    Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?
                    Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances
                    in one day. But over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will
                    begin to attract what you want. Once you master this power of thought,
                        there are truly no limits to what you can create!

                <p class="we-do-wrapper-article-info__text">Successful businesses have many things in common,
                    today we’ll look at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.
                    Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party.
                    Both walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and
                    unnoticed as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the
                    far side because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet
                    acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to model your business after?
                    Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not.
                    If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few competitors,
                    that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of your client’s
                    minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to people.
                    Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and
                    keeping it there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in
                    business. Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition.
                    I am reminded of both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past.
                    They run continually with a catch phrase or musical jingle over and over again
                    on the radio or television until you are absolutely sick of hearing it.
                    You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type of advertising is
                    expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite high.
                    Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal.
                    In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your potential
                    customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your customers.
                    There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your
                    target market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations
                    that will best be seen by them. Another factor to consider is “can I market myself
                    in a place where I will stand out from my competition, or where my competition
                does not have a presence?” Why would you market yourself in a flyer or newspaper
                    right beside your competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being
                    ignored?  Another issue to look at is diversification. As the saying goes,
                    “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising
                    budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue
                    to reap during the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or
                    television promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what
                    about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the impression of where
                    did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything about them for so long.
                    Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears
                    open for the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs
                    of technology coming down dramatically new options such as digital advertising
                    on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more affordable, and the paper
                billboards and posters becoming a thing of the past.With the flexibility, and curb
                    appeal of full color and motion video footage with computer generated graphics available to you,
                    this is an option you don’t want to pass by without a good look. Ultimately, recognition
                    is required if you want to get people “in the door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses).
                    This is going to cost you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but
                    if you have successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it.
